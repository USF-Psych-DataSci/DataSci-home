What to do when you are stuck…

Debugging things in R or other code can be a daunting process,
but with some practice, you will get really good at helping yourself
to diagnose and resolve your problems, as well as at effectively
asking others for help.

The links below contain excellent self-help advice.

One of the great things about working in R is that the R community online is 
amazingly friendly and helpful. That said, when you are just getting started, 
I recommend you ask me or your peers in the Discussion channel on Teams first, before posting to external forums. This will help give you practice forming
clear and precise questions that will permit others to be most helpful to you.

Here are some good resources to get your head in the right place.

  * [Google is your friend](http://xkcd.com/627/). Google is your friend. Google is your friend.
  
    - e.g., Copy the error message, maybe strip out anything highly specific, 
      such the name of your R objects, surround with quotes, and Google it!
    - Try to start your search with "R" or "rstats"
    - Personally, I use [DuckDuckGo.com](https://DuckDuckGo.com) instead of Google for privacy reasons.

  * This stackoverflow thread
    [How to make a great R reproducible example?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5963269/how-to-make-a-great-r-reproducible-example/5963610#5963610) 
    is fantastic. I find that, in the process of preparing a reproducible 
    example, I can often answer my own question. So it is a useful exercise even 
    if you aren't ready to ask for help yet. The process of stripping your 
    problem down to its bare essence often reveals where the root issue lies. 
    **Highly recommended!**
  
  * Search [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and include the `[r]` tag. 
    Or the `[ggplot2]` tag. Or the `[dplyr]` tag. You get the idea.

  * Check out [The R Inferno](http://www.burns-stat.com/documents/books/the-r-inferno/) 
    (see the 9th circle: "Unhelpfully seeking help").
  
    - If someone has the wit and knowledge to answer your question, they probably 
      have a lot of demands on their time. Members of the community are often very
      willing to help, but do your best to make it easy for them. Making your 
      message clear, concise, and user-friendly gives you the best chance of someone
      being able to help you with your problem. 
    
    - Be respectful of people's time. Respond to follow-up questions, provide concise
      reproducible examples, and don't get upset if someone takes longer than
      expected to get back to you. Remember, folks are volunteering their time
      in these venues.
  
  * Read the [R-help posting guide](http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html). 
    *But don't rush to post any questions there, it's not the most beginner-friendly venue!*
