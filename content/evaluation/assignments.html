<p>When a new assignment is posted, a GitHub Issue will be posted in the <a href="https://github.com/USF-Psych-DataSci-2020/Announcements">Announcements</a>
repo. Students will be tagged, so you should get an email notification as well.</p>
<p>All assignments are due by 23:59 Monday. <a href="/evaluation/peer-review">Peer code reviews</a>
are then due by 23:59 Tuesday. Final revisions to assignments are due by 23:59
Wednesday.</p>
<p>You don’t necessarily need to have completed the assignment by the Monday due date,
but this will limit your ability to benefit from your peer reviews. Please respect
your peers’ time by providing them as complete a product as possible to review.</p>

<div id="setting-up-your-homework-repository" class="section level2">
<h2>Setting up your homework repository</h2>
<p>You will each create a single homework repository using GitHub Classroom where
you will submit each of your assignments for the semester. (Note that this is
different from your in-class participation repo.)</p>
<p>To create the repository, just follow <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/MpvBEz_g">this link</a>,
and follow the instructions. Your homework repository will be created for you in the <a href="https://github.com/USF-Psych-DataSci-2020/">USF-Psych-DataSci-2020</a> Organization
under the name <code>DataSci-hw-&lt;your username&gt;</code>. You only have to do this once.</p>
<p>FYI: This repository is public.</p>
</div>
<div id="working-on-your-homework" class="section level2">
<h2>Working on your homework</h2>
<p>When you begin working on an assignment, create a new
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository">branch</a>
in your homework repository. Give this branch a useful name (e.g., <code>hw01</code>). Work
on drafts of your assignments in this branch. This will help to facilitate peer
code review (see below).</p>
<p>As you work on your assignment, you should commit and push your progress to
GitHub. As a word of advice:</p>
<p><strong>Commit your work often!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commit your work often!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Commit your work often!</strong></p>
<p>Too many times, I see students wait until they finish their assignments to
commit and push to GitHub. This is a very bad idea for at least two reasons:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you submit your work late, I will have to give you the late penalty. But
if you’ve been committing your work, I can at least look at your repo as it
was after the latest commit before the deadline.</p></li>
<li><p>Your workflow will not be as effective as it could be by using version control.
If you make a change that breaks something, you won’t be able to go back and
isolate when the breakage happened.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Submitting your homework</h2>
<div id="monday-submission" class="section level3">
<h3>Monday submission</h3>
<p>First you are going to make your assignment available for peer review:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>If you’re working locally (i.e., on your hard drive), push your work to your
GitHub homework repository.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request">pull request</a>
from your homework branch to the <code>master</code> branch in your homework repo.
<a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/requesting-a-pull-request-review">Request code reviews</a>
from your two assigned reviews by adding their names to review menu on the
right side of the screen.</p></li>
<li><p>Your classmates will review your code. After they have reviewed your code,
make any additional changes in response to their reviews or otherwise.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you have completed your revisions, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/merging-a-pull-request">merge</a>
your pull request back into your <code>master</code> branch.</p></li>
</ol>

<div id="wednesday-submission" class="section level3">
<h3>Wednesday submission</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Merge your homework branch back into your <code>master</code> branch if you haven’t already.</p></li>
<li><p>On your GitHub homework repository, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/">tag a release</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>As a “tag version”, I recommend putting <code>hw1.0</code> for assignment 1,
<code>hw2.0</code> for assignment 2, etc.
<ul>
<li>If you want to make changes to your release before the deadline, just tag a
new release like <code>hw1.1</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Go to the course page on <a href="https://usflearn.instructure.com/courses/1481210">Canvas</a>,
and find the corresponding assignment submission. Submit a URL to the latest
release of your assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can find this by clicking on the “Release” button on your GitHub
homework repository, on (for example) the <code>hw1.0</code> text.</li>

<div id="tidy-submission" class="section level2">
<h2>Tidy submission</h2>
<p>Each assignment will have some marks set aside for a “tidy” submission.</p>
<p>Before submitting your work, make sure it’s tidy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each assignment should be self-contained in a folder within your homework
repo, found in <a href="https://github.com/USF-Psych-DataSci-2020/">USF-Psych-DataSci-2020 Org</a>.
<ul>
<li>Exception for Assignment 01, which also evaluates your repo’s <code>README.md</code> file.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Your work must be reproducible from beginning to end. That is, I must be able
to run all code error-free and reproduce the output files.</li>
<li>Your scripts must not contain code that installs packages (this is not good
practice anyway)—note that this is different from loading packages with the
<code>library()</code> function, which is good!</li>
<li>All R Markdown files are <code>knit</code>ted to a readable output. This means linking to
HTML files if you make them (see section on “Viewing and linking to HTML files”).
You can also knit to <code>output: github_document</code> if you want a Markdown file that
renders nicely for GitHub.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="viewing-and-linking-to-html-files" class="section level2">
<h2>Viewing and linking to HTML files</h2>
<p>Viewing an HTML file on GitHub only shows you the HTML code, not the rendered
script. You’ll need to provide a link to a rendered, viewable version of each
HTML file you produce. Here’s how you do that using <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Enable “GitHub pages” on your repo:
<ul>
<li>Go to “Settings” on your repo and stay on the default “Options” tab.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the “GitHub Pages” section.</li>
<li>Under “Source”, click the “None” drop-down button, and select the branch
you want to turn into a website (probably “master”).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Also under the “GitHub Pages” section, you’ll find your website URL. Make
note of this URL.
<ul>
<li>This URL will show a rendered version of your repo’s README, but this is not
important.</li>
<li>Just by enabling GitHub Pages, your HTML files are now viewable rendered by
your browser. Technically, you just turned your GitHub repo into a website.
The only trick is <em>navigating</em> to that HTML page, since there’s no default
<em>interface</em> to your website.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Obtain the URL to HTML file on your repo:
<ul>
<li>Start with your GitHub Pages URL that you made note of in Step 2. This points to the root of your repository.</li>
<li>Get the path to an HTML file you want to view. It should be something like
<code>/path/to/file.html</code> (in this case, <code>file.html</code> lives in the <code>to</code> folder,
which lives in the <code>path</code> folder in the root of your repo).</li>
<li>Append the path to the HTML file to the end of your GitHub Pages URL. Try
the URL to see that it works.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Make it easy for a visitor to your repo to find the rendered HTML file! Add a
link to the rendered HTML file somewhere in your repo, probably in a <code>README</code>
file in your homework folder.</li>
</ol>
