title: "Peer Code Reviews"
---


As part of this course you will be reviewing and commenting on other students' 
assignments. This is a mandatory part of the course and you will be graded on 
your peer reviews.

Here is a template for giving a peer review: [markdown version](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USF-Psych-DataSci/DataSci-home/master/content/evaluation/peer-review-template.md)
or [formatted version](/evaluation/peer-review-template).

## Schedule

The table below gives deadlines for peer code reviews. Links to the peer review
assignments will appear after the assignment is posted.

All submissions are due by 23:59.

Peer code reviews are due by 23:59 Tuesday. 


## Peer code review process

When a new assignment is posted, I will post a link to the peer review assignments for that assignment in Teams.

The linked page will show a table listing two classmates whose code you should review. 
Navigate to your classmates' homework assignment pull requests and look them over. 
Make comments, either inline, at the bottom of the pull request page, or both. 
To let your classmates know you have finished your review, be sure to click the "Complete Review" button and also write a comment tagging them.

After you have completed your review, submit links to the two reviews you left in the designated area in Teams.


## Expectations

Your reviews should contain thoughtful, constructive, and considerate comments. 
They should be specific and concise, and they should address the specific code and style of the submission you are reviewing.

You will receive an F if your review is mean or disrespectful.


## Resources

How to give a good peer review:

- Give thoughtful, constructive and considerate comments.
- Be specific and concise.
- Follow the [review template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USF-Psych-DataSci/DataSci-home/master/content/evaluation/peer-review-template.md) as a guide for the types of things you should comment on.
- Try to learn something new and, if you succeed, point that out.
- If you can't find anything to praise or that you found helpful, then at least offer some suggestions in a kind way.

Peer reviewing and critiquing others' work (especially their code) is a useful skill to develop during your studies. Although these links deal mainly with peer review of academic papers, most of the key points are applicable to our peer code review process.
