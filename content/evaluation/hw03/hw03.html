<div id="overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The goal is to manipulate and explore a dataset with the <code>dplyr</code> package,
complemented by visualizations made with <code>ggplot2</code>. You can think of this as a
deeper version of Homework 02.</p>
</div>
<div id="setup" class="section level2">
<h2>Setup</h2>
<p>Work with one of the data sets we explored in class, such as <code>gapminder</code>,
<code>psych::bfi</code>. You can work with another dataset (or more than one dataset) if
you want.</p>

<h2>The Assignment (90%)</h2>
<hr />
<p>Rubric for each task:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_quality.md">code quality</a>: (10%)
<ul>
<li>Did you use the tidyverse (dplyr, ggplot2) where appropriate?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_viz.md">vis quality</a>: (10%)
<ul>
<li>Did you produce an effective plot?</li>
</ul></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/blob/master/rubric/rubric_accuracy.md">tibble accuracy</a>: (10%)
<ul>
<li>does your tibble reflect the task?</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Pick <em><em>three</em></em> of the tasks below, and, for each selected task, produce:</p>
<ul>
<li>a tibble, using <code>dplyr</code> as your data manipulation tool;</li>
<li>an accompanying plot of data from the tibble, using <code>ggplot2</code> as your visualization tool; and</li>
<li>some dialogue about what your tables/figures show (doesn’t have to be much).
<ul>
<li>The idea is to structure your assignment like it’s an actual report someone
might read.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Or, make up your own task(s)! If you want to do something comparable but different,
i.e. swap one quantitative variable for another, be my guest! If you are feeling
inspired and curious, then we’re doing this right. Go for it. Just write down the
task that you are now doing. Between the <code>dplyr</code> coverage in class and the list
below, I think you get the idea.</p>
<p>Relax about the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your figure does not have to depict every single number from the data
aggregation result. Use your judgement. It just needs to complement the table,
add context, and allow for some sanity checking both ways.</li>
<li>Tidying/reshaping is NOT your assignment. Many of your tables will be
awkwardly shaped in the report. That’s OK.</li>
<li>Table beauty is not a big deal. Simply printing to “screen” is fine.
<ul>
<li>You can do either <code>print()</code> or <code>knitr::kable()</code> to output your tables.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Tip: Treat this assignment as a “cheat sheet” for future-you! Don’t assume that
you’ll remember the lessons you learned while writing this assignment. Write
things down:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add notes on difficulties/oddities you encountered. For example, which figures
are easy/hard to make, which data formats make better inputs for plotting
functions vs. for human-friendly tables.</li>
<li>Provide attribution whenever you take code or an idea from somewhere else,
whether a blog post, a colleague, a vignette, etc. Putting those pointers in
your “cheat sheet” will be useful for future-you – and it’s just good
practice to indicate where you got things from.</li>

<div id="task-option-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Task Option 1</h3>
<p>Work with <code>gapminder</code>. Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries
with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of
worldwide life expectancy—you decide−a mean or median or some other quantile or
perhaps your current age. Then determine how many countries on each continent
have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-option-2" class="section level3">
<h3>Task Option 2</h3>
<p>Work with <code>gapminder</code>. Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all
continents.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-option-3" class="section level3">
<h3>Task Option 3</h3>
<p>Work with <code>gapminder</code>. Look at the spread/variability of GDP per capita within
the continents.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-option-4" class="section level3">
<h3>Task Option 4</h3>
<p>Work with <code>gapminder</code>. Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different
years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other
than the plain vanilla mean.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-option-5" class="section level3">
<h3>Task Option 5</h3>
<p>Work with <code>gapminder</code>. How is life expectancy changing over time on different
continents?</p>
</div>
<div id="task-option-6" class="section level3">
<h3>Task Option 6</h3>
<p>Work with <code>gapminder</code>. Find countries with interesting stories. This task is
open-ended and, therefore, hard. Promising but unsuccessful attempts are
encouraged. Be sure to include them in your submission! This will generate
interesting questions to follow up on in class.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-option-7" class="section level3">
<h3>Task Option 7</h3>
<p>Work with <code>psych::bfi</code>. Compute composite scores for the five Big Five scores,
including both person-mean scores and person-sd scores. Describe the
distributions of the different personality variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-option-8" class="section level3">
<h3>Task Option 8</h3>
<p>Work with <code>psych::bfi</code>. Using the composite scores from Task 7, describe the
relationships among the different personality variables.</p>
</div>
<div id="task-option-9" class="section level3">
<h3>Task Option 9</h3>
<p>Work with <code>psych::bfi</code>. Using the composite scores from Task 7, explore how age
is related to the different personality variables. Does personality appear to
change for different ages?</p>
</div>
<div id="task-option-10" class="section level3">
<h3>Task Option 10</h3>
<p>Work with <code>psych::bfi</code>. Using the composite scores from Task 7, explore how gender
is related to the different personality variables.</p>
</div>

<div id="optional-exercise-2" class="section level2">
<h2>Optional Exercise (2%)</h2>
<p>Get a table and figure to show side-by-side.
