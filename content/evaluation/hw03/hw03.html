<h1>Homework 03</h1>
<p>You will analyze data looking at the relationship between <strong>green reputation</strong> and three personality traitsâ€“<strong>compassion</strong>, <strong>intellectual curiosity</strong>, and <strong>openness to experiences</strong>.
The dataset includes data from <strong>students</strong> and <strong>non-students</strong>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Remove `eval = FALSE` from the code chunk options when you work with the homework
dictionary &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;green_dictionary.csv&quot;)
green_data &lt;- readr::read_csv(&quot;green_data.csv&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>For your assignment, do the following.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Inspect the item responses (e.g., with graphs or by summarizing distinct values).
Is anything unusual?</li>
<li>Compute total scores for the four scales.
Recode variables as needed.</li>
<li>Rescale the variables so that they go from 0-100 instead of the original range.
Name the recaled variables <code>*_pomp</code>.</li>
<li>Make plots that illustrate the distributions of the 4 POMP-scored variables.</li>
<li>Make scatterplots showing the relationships between <strong>green reputation</strong> and each personality trait.
Include trend lines for <strong>students</strong> and <strong>non-students</strong>.
What do these plots show?</li>
<li>Compare <strong>green reputation</strong> for students and non-students using a <strong>rainfall plot</strong> (bar + density + data points).</li>
<li>Compute a summary table of means, SDs, medians, minima, and maxima for the four total scores for students and non-students.</li>
</ol>
<p>In your assignment, prepare an RMarkdown file that includes both the coding and (for 4-7) narrative descriptions of your results.</p>
