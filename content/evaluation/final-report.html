<p>The last component of your evaluation fro the course will be a final report.
This is a mandatory part of the course (20% of overall course grade).</p>
<p>For this report, you must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a dataset to address a research question of interest to you.</li>
<li>Import it to R</li>
<li>Wrangle it</li>
<li>Produce analytic results and visualizations to address your question</li>
</ul>
<p>Your report should describe the research question and the nature of your dataset.
It should then describe the initial state of the data, the process you use to wrangle
the data, the analyses or visualizations you produce with the data, and the
substantive conclusions you draw.</p>
<p>Several datasets will be provided in class, or you may procure your own.</p>

<h3>Graduate Students</h3>
<p>For graduate students in the course, the final project must be related to your
thesis or dissertation research. It should include developing a data management
and analysis workflow for your paper. Depending on the nature of your project and
the state of data collection, the project may also include wrangling, exploring,
and visualizing your dataset, or it may entail using data simulations to
(1) develop a computational model for your hypothetical processes,
(2) generate and explore plausible data under alternative hypotheses, and/or
(3) conduct sample size planning for your data collection.</p>

<h2>Format</h2>
<p>The report should be prepared in APA format. The <a href="https://github.com/crsh/papaja">papaja package</a>
is a useful tool for preparing documents in APA format. The <a href="https://zotero.org/download">Zotero program</a>
combined with the <a href="https://github.com/retorquere/zotero-better-bibtex/releases">BetterBibTeX plugin</a>
is useful for formatting citations into your document.</p>
