## Overview

Due Tuesday 2018-10-19 at 23:59.

Goals:

* Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
* Write some data to file and load it back into R.
* Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
* Make a plotly visual.
* Implement visualization design principles.

Remember the [sampler concept](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampler_(needlework)). Your homework should serve as your own personal cheatsheet in the future for canonical tasks. Make things nice -- your future self will thank you!

### Evaluation

All rubrics listed on the [assignments](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/) page are relevant for this assignment.

For this assignment, you can think of the scores loosely this way:

0: Did not attempt.

1: One or more elements are missing or sketchy. Missed opportunities to complement code and numbers with a figure and interpretation. Technical problem that is relatively easy to fix. It's hard to find the report in this crazy repo.

2: Hits all the elements. No obvious mistakes. Pleasant to read. No heroic detective work required. Well done!

3: Exceeded the requirements in number of dimensions. Developed novel tasks that were indeed interesting and "worked". Impressive use of R -- maybe involving functions, packages or workflows that weren't given in class materials. Impeccable organization of repo and report. You learned something new from reviewing their work and you're eager to incorporate it into your work.

### Data

You can work with the gapminder data, or adapt the tasks to suit some other data set, such as [Joey's singer dataset](https://github.com/JoeyBernhardt/singer).

## The Assignment

### Part 1: Factor management

With the data set of your choice, after ensuring the variable(s) you're exploring are indeed factors, you are expected to:

1. Drop factor / levels;
2. Reorder levels based on knowledge from data.

We've elaborated on these steps for the gapminder and singer data sets below.

Be sure to also characterize the (derived) data before and after your factor re-leveling:

* Explore the effects of `arrange()`. Does merely arranging the data have any effect on, say, a figure?
* Explore the effects of reordering a factor and factor reordering coupled with `arrange()`. Especially, what effect does this have on a figure?

These explorations should involve the data, the factor levels, and some figures.

#### Elaboration for the gapminder data set

**Drop Oceania.** Filter the Gapminder data to remove observations associated with the `continent` of Oceania.  Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and Oceania; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.

**Reorder the levels of `country` or `continent`.** Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.

#### Elaboration for the Singer data set

If necessary, transform some of the variables in the `singer_locations` dataframe into factors: pay attention at what levels you introduce and their order. Try and consider the difference between the base R `as.factor` and the `forcats`-provided functions.

**Drop 0.** Filter the `singer_locations` data to remove observations associated with the uncorrectly inputed `year` 0.  Additionally, remove unused factor levels. Provide concrete information on the data before and after removing these rows and levels; address the number of rows and the levels of the affected factors.

**Reorder the levels of `year`, `artist_name` or `title`.** Use the forcats package to change the order of the factor levels, based on a principled summary of one of the quantitative variables. Consider experimenting with a summary statistic beyond the most basic choice of the median.


### Part 2: File I/O

Experiment with one or more of `write_csv()/read_csv()` (and/or TSV friends), `saveRDS()/readRDS()`, `dput()/dget()`. Create something new, probably by filtering or grouped-summarization of Singer or Gapminder. I highly recommend you fiddle with the factor levels, i.e. make them non-alphabetical (see previous section). Explore whether this survives the round trip of writing to file then reading back in.

### Part 3: Visualization design

Remake at least one figure or create a new one, in light of something you learned in the recent class meetings about visualization design and color. Maybe juxtapose your first attempt and what you obtained after some time spent working on it. Reflect on the differences. If using Gapminder, you can use the country or continent color scheme that ships with Gapminder. Consult the dimensions listed in [All the Graph Things](http://stat545.com/graph00_index.html).

Then, make a new graph by converting this visual (or another, if you'd like) to a `plotly` graph. What are some things that `plotly` makes possible, that are not possible with a regular `ggplot2` graph?

### Part 4: Writing figures to file

Use `ggsave()` to explicitly save a plot to file. Then use `![Alt text](/path/to/img.png)` to load and embed it in your report. You can play around with various options, such as:

* Arguments of `ggsave()`, such as width, height, resolution or text scaling.
* Various graphics devices, e.g. a vector vs. raster format.
* Explicit provision of the plot object `p` via `ggsave(..., plot = p)`. Show a situation in which this actually matters.

### But I want to do more!

If you're particularly keen on levelling up the challenge of this assignment, try these things (this is all optional):

Make a deeper exploration of the forcats packages, i.e. try more of the factor level reordering functions.

Revalue a factor, e.g.:

* **Gapminder version**: Pick a handful of countries, each of which you can associate with a stereotypical food (or any other non-controversial thing ... sport? hobby? type of music, art or dance? animal? landscape feature?). Create an excerpt of the Gapminder data, filtered to just these countries. Create a new factor -- you pick the name! -- by mapping the existing country factor levels to the new levels.
    - Examples: Italy --> wine, Germany --> beer, Japan --> sake. (Austria, Germany) --> German, (Mexico, Spain) --> Spanish, (Portugal, Brazil) --> Portuguese. Let your creativity flourish.

* **Singer version**: Pick a handful of locations (they are named `city`, try using `distinct()`) that you can pinpoint to a geographical place (city, region, country, continent,...). Create an excerpt of the Singer data, filtered to just those rows. Create a (couple of) new factor(s) -- you pick the name(s)! -- by mapping the existing `city` factor levels to the new (city, region, country...) levels.
    - Examples: "London, England" --> "London", "England", "UK", "Europe";  
    - "Los Angeles, CA" --> "Los Angeles", "California", "USA", "Americas";
    - ...
    - "310, Louisiana" --> "New Orleans", "Louisiana", "USA", "Americas".  
    
You could even try to make this process of geolocalization more streamlined: you may want to try and use the `separate` function from tidyr.
  
### Finishing up, and Reflection

Once you're done the above, go back to [UBC canvas](https://canvas.ubc.ca/), and find the "Homework 05" page.

You're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. As usual, put this reflection on your canvas submission. No need to write lots here.
