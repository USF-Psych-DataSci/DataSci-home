title: "Assignment 04: Preparing a project folder"
---

## Objective

In this assignment, you are going to think about your final project for the class and setup a project folder. 

You have learned a lot about data wrangling and project management! 
You know how to use the tidyverse to:

  * Filter rows and select variables in a principled or name-based manner
  * Modify variables and create new variables
  * Group rows of a data frame and do summarizing or mutating computations within group
  * Reshape a data frame

The goal of this homework is to solidify your data wrangling skills by working with some realistic data.

If you internalize that there are multiple solutions to most problems, you will spend less time banging your head against the wall in data analysis. 
If something's really hard, sneak up on it from a different angle.

## Step 1: Set up your folder structure

In your homework repo, create a `final_project` folder. 
Prepare your folder structure inside this folder for your final project. 
Folders and files you should probably include in this folder structure are:
  
  - A `README.me` file describing the project and the contents of the subfolders
  - An RStudio Project .Rproj file in the folder root
  - A `data` folder that holds the relevant data files for the project
    - Could also have separate `data_raw` and `data` folders
  - One or more RMarkdown manuscripts
  - An `output` folder that will hold your output files
    - Depending on how many figures and other output files you may have, 
      you might want to split/subfolder this into `figures`, `reports`, etc.
  - Other subfolders as needed, e.g.:
    - `admin` for adminstrative documents (e.g., IRB approval, grant information)
    - `doc` for documentation (e.g., variable codebooks), 
    - ``R` as a place to store functions and scripts that you call from your markdown (e.g., a data import and cleaning script)
      
All of these folders should be described in your README.md file for this project (e.g., make a markdown table describing the folders).


## Step 2: Find, download, and document a dataset

In this step, you need to identify a dataset you want to work with for your final project. 

Some potential sources for datasets include:

  - [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/)
  - [Google Datasets](https://www.blog.google/products/search/discovering-millions-datasets-web/)
  - [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/)
  - [FiveThirtyEight's GitHub repos](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data)
  - Data from your own research work or experience
  
The requirements for this dataset:

  - It cannot be already available as an R package like `gapminder`, `nycflights13`, or one of the datasets in `datasets`
    - It's okay if there is any R package you use to download the data, such as
      `rtweet`, so long as it isn't already a neatly packaged dataset for you.
  - It should be a dataset that needs some cleaning, reshaping, wrangling before it's ready for analysis. This is the case for almost any real-world data.
  
Talk to me if you are having trouble finding an interesting or suitable dataset!

Once you have identified a dataset, download it and place it in your `data` folder.

  - If this is data you are downloading from the internet, write and run a .R script to download the dataset
    - Hint: Try to write this as a separate .R file from your homework .Rmd file
      and call it in your .Rmd using `source()`.
  - If you are working with data from your own research work, you can place it directly in the folder
    - If the files are hosted somewhere online, on another server, or elsewhere, write a .R script to retrieve them, as described above.
  - Your data file should have a useful descriptive name (no `data.xlsx`!). 
    It should include:
    - A description of the file (e.g., "gapminder-data-all-countries")
    - A date in a sortable format (e.g., "2020-03-04")
    - No spaces
    - The file extension (e.g., ".csv" or ".xlsx")

Document your data. 
Describe the key variables, their types (e.g., character, integrer, numeric), their possible values (e.g., for a personality item, maybe integers from 1-5), etc. 
Describe how missing data is indicated (blank cells, "NA", "-999", etc.). 
This documentation could be in the main project README.md file or in a README.md or other .md file in the `data` folder.


## Step 3: Practice input, process, output

In your .Rmd file for this homework assignment (call it `hw04.Rmd`), practice reading your data file into R, processing the imported data, and outputting files. 
Import your file using R functions (not the buttons in RStudio). 

You will want to output two things:

  1. A data file, such as cleaned dataset and/or a summarized dataset/table
  2. A plot, in several formats, including (1) a bitmap format, (2) a vector format, and (3) PDF
  
While your processing and plot should be useful, **you don't have to do the entire final project now**! 

The point of this exercise is to practice reading your files into R, working with them, and then saving your outputs to disk (other than/in addition to the files that are output when you knit a .Rmd file).

Save your data file and plots to your `output` folder (or other more specific folders if that is your structure). 
Be sure to use descriptive file names and document what these files are with a .md file.

Save your data file using `write_csv()` or a similar function. 
Save your images using `ggsave()`. 
Do not use the buttons in RStudio.
