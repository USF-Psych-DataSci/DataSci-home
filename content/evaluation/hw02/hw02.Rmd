title: "Assignment 02: Explore gapminder and use dplyr"
---

## Objective

The goal is to practice with `ggplot2` and `dplyr` to explore a dataset.


## Setup

Work with the `gapminder::gapminder` data we explored in class.

Load up the packages you will need for this assignment using `library()`:

```{r}

```


## Tidy Submission

Please be sure to follow the instructions for making a **tidy submission**, found on the [assignments home page](/evaluation/assignments).


## Exercise 1: Basic `dplyr`

Use `dplyr` functions to achieve the following.

### 1.1

Use `filter()` to subset the `gapminder` data to three countries of your choice in the 1970's.

### 1.2

Use the pipe operator `%>%` to select "country" and "gdpPercap" from your filtered dataset in 1.1.

### 1.3

Make a new variable in `gapminder` for the change in life expectancy from the previous measurement. 
Filter this table to show all of the entries that have experienced a **drop** in life expectancy.

__Hint__: you might find the `lag()` or `diff()` functions useful. 

### 1.4

Filter `gapminder` so that it shows the max GDP per capita experienced by 
each country. 

__Hint__: you might find the `max()` function useful here. 

### 1.5

Produce a scatterplot of Canada's life expectancy vs. GDP per capita using 
`ggplot2`, without defining a new variable. 
That is, after filtering the `gapminder` data set, pipe it directly into the `ggplot()` function. 
In your plot, put GDP per capita on a **log scale**. 


## Exercise 2: Explore two variables with `dplyr` and `ggplot2`

Use `palmerpenguins::penguins` or another dataset of your choice.
(Check out a dataset from the `datasets` R package if you want!)

### 2.1 

Pick two **quantitative** variables to explore. 

* Make a summary table of descriptive statistics for these variables using `summarize()`.
  - Include whatever staistics you feel appropriate (mean, median sd, range, etc.).
* Make a scatterplot of these variables using `ggplot()`.

### 2.2 

Pick one *categorical* variable and one *quantitative* variable to explore. 

* Make a summary table giving the sample size (hint: `n()`) and descriptive statistics for the quantitative variable by group.
* Make one or more useful plots to visualize these variables.


## Bonus Exercise: Recycling (Optional)

Evaluate this code and describe the result. 
The goal was to get the data for Rwanda and Afghanistan. 
Does this work? Why or why not? 
If not, what is the correct way to do this?

```
filter(gapminder, country == c("Rwanda", "Afghanistan"))
```
