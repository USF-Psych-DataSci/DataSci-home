<p>In addition to <a href="https://www.usf.edu/provost/faculty/core-syllabus-policy-statements.aspx">USF’s institution-wide policies about disability access, religious observances, academic grievances, academic misconduct, and several other topics</a>, this course adopts the following policies.</p>
<div id="late-policy" class="section level2">
<h2>Late Policy</h2>
<p>I get it, we’re in the middle of a pandemic. If you need extra time on something, just let me know. I don’t need to know your private medical or personal information. Just give me a heads up.</p>
</div>
<div id="plagiarism" class="section level2">
<h2>Plagiarism</h2>
<p>Plagiarism, which is intellectual theft, occurs where an individual submits or presents the oral or written work of another person as his or her own and can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>multiple students submitting the same response</li>
<li>copying from sources without citing them</li>
<li>copying verbatim (word-for-word) from source and citing, but failing to make it explicit that this is a quotation (quotations should be used only rarely, if at all)</li>
</ul>
<p>Students are responsible for ensuring that any work submitted does not constitute plagiarism. Students who are in any doubt as to what constitutes plagiarism should consult me before handing in any assignments.</p>
<div id="code-plagiarism" class="section level4">
<h4>Code Plagiarism</h4>
<p>Students must correctly cite any code that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of code plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>the reproduction (copying and pasting) of code with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)</li>
<li>the translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another</li>
<li>the generation of code by automatic code-generations software</li>
</ul>
<p>An “adequate acknowledgment” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.</p>
